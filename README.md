This project aims to provide strategic support to estate agents and property sellers
in Melbourne, helping them to set sale prices that optimise liquidity, long-term profit
and fair market prices. 

Methodology: 
#descriptive analysis (Power BI & Excel),
#exploratory analysis (Python), 
#predictive analysis (Machine Learning with XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost).

Deliverables: 
#Dashboard in Power BI, 
#Application in Streamlit, 
#Documentation in Excel and
#README. 

Results: 
 Practical tool for setting strategic prices, based on historical data and predictive models, increasing assertiveness and reducing risks.

Each code and tool had a specific role:

- EDA_1.py: Performs initial exploratory analysis of sales data.
- preprocess_failure_2.py: Tests and adjusts preprocessing methods to clean and prepare the data.
- XGBoost_LightGBM_CatBoost3.py: Applies the main machine learning algorithms to predict prices.
- advanced_models4.py: Tests more advanced models, adjusting parameters and comparing performance.
- Importance_Permutation5.py: Measures the importance of variables to understand what most impacts price.
- app.py (6): Creates the interactive user interface via Streamlit.
- Power BI: Builds visual dashboards for quick market insights.
- Excel: Organises the initial database and supports analysis.
